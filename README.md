## OPERATIONS
- If skip wants to send sweep hard command to Right sweeper: holding down the Right button 
- If skip wants to send sweep soft command to Right sweeper: press the Right button 
- If skip wants to send sweep hard command to Left sweeper: holding down the Left button 
- If skip wants to send sweep soft command to Left sweeper: press the Left button
- If skip wants to send stop command: press the Stop button to broadcast stop command to both sweepers

## In other words:
- Stop: press the stop button
- Hard sweep: holding down on a button 
- Soft sweep: press a button

## DEVICES
- ESP-A: Skip device 
- ESP-B: Right sweep device 
- ESP-C: Left sweep device

## NOTES
- Getting started with ESP32:
  - Board module: NodeMCU-32s
  - Everytime uploading to board, hold IO0 button until connection established
- For easy understanding and coding, use the same pins for IO accordingly on both boards.
- GNDs on each board should not be tied together. GND for different devices are different.
- Each device on each board should have different GND
- 4-leg LED can have different wiring diagrams: common anode, or common cathode. The ones I have is common cathode.
- Since my wiring is common cathode, my program is sending LOW to turn LED ON, and sending HIGH to turn LED OFF
